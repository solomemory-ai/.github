**Your AI agents forget everything after each session.**<br>
**We're fixing that.**

<br>

## The Problem

Every conversation with an AI starts from zero. Your preferences, your codebase patterns, your past decisions — gone. You repeat yourself endlessly.

## The Solution

Solo Memory gives AI agents persistent, graph-powered memory. End-to-end cloud. Zero setup. Just works.

```
Session 1: "I prefer functional components over classes"
Session 47: Agent already knows. No reminder needed.
```
